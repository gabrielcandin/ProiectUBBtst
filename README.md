# About 

This repository contains the full codebase from Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). 

The final product is in sample_app, and is a miniature social network which takes students through the full features of the Ruby on Rails framework, with a full SQLite backend and a semi-responsive front-end utilizing the Bootstrap theme and Jquery plugins. 

The sample app features:

1. User pages with profile pictures
2. Microposts (featuring a 140 character limit, a la Twitter) for users
3. Ability to follow/be followed by users
5. Image uploads for microposts

To run the application, you need a full rails environment, and once that is set up you can simply run 

```
$ rails server
```

and launch the sample app on http://localhost:3000. 

Note that the sample app was developed for a test mode only, omitting any Heroku/AWS deployment since I intended this tutorial to be a pure introduction to Ruby on Rails itelf.

Here are some screenshots from the application:
